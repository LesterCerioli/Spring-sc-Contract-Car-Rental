= NodeJS app

This terribly simple NodeJS App sends a request to `http://localhost:9876/frauds` and prints in
on the response.

== Required modules

```
npm install request
```

== How to run it

=== Failing scenario

Run it without running stub runner boot and show that it will fail.

```
$ node app.js
```

you will get sth like this

```
ERROR - status [404]
```

=== Passing scenario

Next run stub runner boot and show how easy it is to start a stub (this assumes that `fraud-detection` stubs were installed locally)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/stub-runner-boot
$ cd stub-runner-boot
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/stub-runner-boot-1.1.0.RELEASE.jar --stubrunner.workOffline=true --stubrunner.ids="com.example:fraud-detection:+:9876"
```

and run the node application again

```
$ node app.js
```

this time you will get sth like this

```javascript
["marcin","josh"]
```
